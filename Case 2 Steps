Case 2: PRODSUP-002:

Steps to complete the case.

1. Go to Github and access the case from URL:  https://github.com/mtedone/podam
2. Go to Circleci and access the dashboard from URL: https://circleci.com/dashboard
3. Create a copy of the project by forking it from Github 
4. Go back to Circleci and give CircleCI permission to access GitHub on your behalf
5. On the left side of the menu look for Projects a list of the Github projects will appear.
6. On the rigth side of the screen click on Configure project.
7. Select the platform you want, on this case it was selected the version 2.0
8. Follow the following instructions given by Circleci:
	a. Create a folder named .circleci and add a fileconfig.yml (so that the filepath be 	in .circleci/config.yml).
	b. Populate the config.yml with the contents of the sample .yml 		
	c. Update the sample .yml to reflect your project's configuration.
	d. Push this change up to GitHub.
	e. Start building! This will launch your project on CircleCI and make our webhooks 	listen for updates to your work.
9. After this step the Circleci will configure the project to be displayed on the plattform.
10. In this case the build gave an error after a period of time (5.162 s) 
11. There was a test trying to be completed for the following file CSVFormat.java
12. Reviewing the code at file path: main/java/org/apache/commons/csv/CSVFormat.java it is a for doing a big loop which causes a lot of time to be compiled this can be found at line 805.
13. The loop was an iteration of 72000 increases of i plus a wait of 1000.
14. The "for" was edited to a lower amount of iterations in order to compile over Circleci.
15. After this the compilation was succesfull.
