Hello Adam,

Thank you for contacting support, my name is Daniel and I will be assisting you with your inquiries. I understand that
you want to know more how CircleCI works and why it does not support .NET technologies.

First of all CircleCI is a tool for continous intregation with automated test support. It has been created to make development tests 
and to deliver processes easier. It gives you the ability to use your Github account and projects so it will run automatically all 
your configured tests. If your tests pass you can deploy your code to development, staging, production and more. 
The general idea is to test all changes that you are making to your code base. 

At the moment CircleCI does not support officially .NET technology, at the moment there are workarounds such as using the 
tool Mono or Docker, also you can always submit a Feature Request in our discussion forum in order to this be considered 
in future versions of CircleCI, you can submit it through this URL: https://discuss.circleci.com/c/feature-requests

I hope this information has been useful to you, in the case that you need more assistance or have any other inquire 
that you need assistance with feel free to reply to this message and gladly I will keep working with you.

Best regards,

Daniel
