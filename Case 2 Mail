Hello Jolene,

Than you for contacting support, my name is Daniel and I will be helping you with your situation. I understand that you want to know 
why your project is not succesfully building over Circleci. 

Reviewing the code everything seems to be running wonderful and smooth, however there is a portion of code located at
main/java/org/apache/commons/csv/CSVFormat.java on which creates an iteration very long causing a great delay on the build.

At the moment in orde to resolve this situation we made a copy of the project and the code was changed to a short iteration
(you can view the changes over the line 805 of the file CSVFormat.java) after this the build was completed succesfully;
currently Circleci just allows a certain amount of time to complete the build for security reasons in order to avoid complex problems.

Since no more information is needed at the moment, this ticket will be closing soon, in case you need further assistance, 
donâ€™t hesitate to reply this message within the next 30 days to reopen the ticket, or you can use any of our contact channels.

Wish you have a great day.

Sincerely, 

Daniel
