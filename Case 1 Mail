Hello Harry,

I understand that you requiere assistance on your project and want to know why the Test Results tab is empty.

To view the tab please follow these instructions:

1. Sing in to your Circleci Dashboard from this URL: https://circleci.com/dashboard
2. Look for your project.
3. On the menu you will see at first the Test Summary, so please click on the Artifacts tab to see your generated test.
4. In the case that you do not see anything you see it empty you need to configure tests by following the instructions given on this 
Help Center article: https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/test-metadata/#java-junit-results-with-maven-surefire-plugin.

I hope you find this information useful. The case remains open awaiting for your response, in the case that 
you have more doubts or questions do not hesitate to contact me back and I will be more than glad to help you 
in everything that is in my hands.

I wish you have a wonderful day and a great rest of your week. 

Best regards,

Daniel
